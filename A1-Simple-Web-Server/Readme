1.Files/directory in p1.tar.gz: Testfile.sh; Makefile; Readme.txt; sws.c; www(test directory)
2.Code design: Here is the very brief pseudo code of my implementation:
	
		initialize client's address info.
                initialize server's address info.
                check command line argument(# of argument, port number, serving directory)
		create a new socket
                bind the socket in local ip address
                record server's info.(port, ip address)
		create a new thread for listening 'q' press 
                while 1 do:
			'q' is not pressed continue
			initialize server output and client response data
			add time stamp and client address info to the server output
			process the request and append the file content of length 1k by 1k to the http response. 
                        send the client response.
				output the server result.
		end


3.I am using a template from online source for both socket part and the terminator method(press q to exit) and modified them inorder 
 to make them work perfectly for my code.
